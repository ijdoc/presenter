# Presenter

Presenter is a simple chrome extension that allows you to draw effemeral rectangles on a page, so you can draw attention to specific areas during a presentation.

I wrote this extension while working at W&B, so by default, the extension is only enabled on W&B domains.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your local file system
1. Go to the chrome extensions settings and enable developer mode
1. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the repository folder you just cloned

## Usage
Every time you reload a W&B page, you will get a small gray circle following your pointer. Just press down on the Shift key (turning the circle red/active) while you drag on an area to highlight it with an effemeral rectangle!
